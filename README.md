Arduino Voltmeter clock

This project creates a voltmeter clock like this instructable.

I wanted to do this myself so am not using code or anything from that project other than the fantastic idea!!


Arduino Components
------------------
- RTC module: http://learn.adafruit.com/ds1307-real-time-clock-breakout-board-kit
- Analog voltage output http://www.instructables.com/id/Analog-Output-Convert-PWM-to-Voltage/ 
- Read a swtich input and light an LED for a time after a press

Hardware Components
-------------------
- Arduino (start with dev then move to a dedicated cheap one)
- Voltage regulation from the wall to 5V (or battery power...)
- Voltmeters (modify to show 1-12 and 0-60)
- PWM and filter into the voltmeters from the arduino
- LEDs installed in the voltmeters
- Switch into the Arduino that turns on the LEDs for 10s after it is pressed
- An attractive box to put it all in
